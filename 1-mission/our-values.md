# OneSyntax Core Values

**These aren't just words on a wall. They guide every decision we make.**

---

## 1. True Partnership

**We are partners, not vendors.**

What this means:
- We challenge ideas that won't work (even if uncomfortable)
- We involve clients in planning and key decisions
- We communicate proactively and honestly
- We take ownership of outcomes, not just deliverables
- We share both successes and failures transparently

**In practice:**
- ✅ "This approach won't scale - here's why and here's a better way"
- ✅ "I need your input on this decision before we proceed"
- ✅ "We made a mistake - here's what happened and how we'll fix it"
- ❌ "Just doing what you asked" (when you know it's wrong)
- ❌ "Not my problem" (everything is our problem)

---

## 2. Disciplined Engineering

**We follow proven practices - not as buzzwords, but as our actual workflow.**

What this means:
- We use DDD to model business problems correctly
- We build Clean Architecture to ensure maintainability
- We write tests first (TDD) to ensure quality
- We refactor continuously to prevent technical debt
- We enforce standards through automation

**In practice:**
- ✅ "Let me model this domain properly before coding"
- ✅ "I'll write the test first to clarify the behavior"
- ✅ "This code needs refactoring before we add more features"
- ❌ "Let's just hack it together and fix it later"
- ❌ "We don't have time for tests" (we MAKE time)

---

## 3. Rapid Validation

**We validate assumptions with real users, not opinions.**

What this means:
- We build MVPs quickly to test core assumptions
- We get in front of users early and often
- We iterate based on real feedback, not gut feelings
- We kill ideas that don't work (without ego)
- We scale what the market validates

**In practice:**
- ✅ "Let's build a minimal version and test it this week"
- ✅ "What are the 3 core assumptions we need to validate?"
- ✅ "The data says users don't want this - let's pivot"
- ❌ "Let's build the whole thing before showing anyone"
- ❌ "I think users will love this" (feelings aren't validation)

---

## 4. Continuous Learning

**We get better every day, every project, every sprint.**

What this means:
- We reflect on what worked and what didn't
- We share knowledge openly across the team
- We invest in deliberate practice and training
- We welcome feedback and act on it
- We teach others what we've learned

**In practice:**
- ✅ "I learned a better way to do this - let me share it"
- ✅ "That didn't work - here's what I'll do differently next time"
- ✅ "Can you review my approach? I want to improve"
- ❌ "This is how I've always done it" (and refuse to change)
- ❌ "I know everything already" (nobody does)

---

## 5. Quality First

**We build systems that last, not systems that barely work.**

What this means:
- We prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term speed
- We fix problems at the root, not with band-aids
- We take pride in craftsmanship
- We don't ship code we're ashamed of
- We measure quality objectively with tests and metrics

**In practice:**
- ✅ "This will take 2 extra days to do right - it's worth it"
- ✅ "I'm not comfortable shipping this until we fix X"
- ✅ "Our test coverage dropped - we need to address this"
- ❌ "Just ship it - we'll fix bugs later" (bugs ARE quality issues)
- ❌ "Good enough" (when it's not actually good)

---

## 6. Radical Transparency

**We communicate honestly, even when it's uncomfortable.**

What this means:
- We share progress, blockers, and risks openly
- We admit mistakes quickly and fix them faster
- We give direct feedback (with kindness)
- We don't hide behind jargon or excuses
- We trust our clients with the truth

**In practice:**
- ✅ "We're behind schedule because of X - here's our recovery plan"
- ✅ "This feature won't work as designed - here's why"
- ✅ "Your feedback on my code was right - I'll fix it"
- ❌ "Everything's fine" (when it's not)
- ❌ "That's just how software development works" (cop-out)

---

## 7. Client Success = Our Success

**We measure ourselves by our clients' outcomes, not our output.**

What this means:
- We care about business impact, not just features shipped
- We think beyond the current sprint to long-term success
- We proactively identify opportunities and risks
- We stay engaged after launch to ensure success
- We celebrate client wins as our own

**In practice:**
- ✅ "How does this feature impact the business metrics?"
- ✅ "I noticed a potential issue in your business model - can we discuss?"
- ✅ "Your product launched successfully - let's optimize next"
- ❌ "I built what you asked for - my job is done"
- ❌ "Not my department" (everything affects client success)

---

## Living These Values

**Values mean nothing if we don't live them daily.**

### For Individual Contributors:
- Ask yourself: "Am I living these values in my work?"
- Challenge teammates when values are being violated
- Bring up concerns in retrospectives
- Lead by example

### For Leaders:
- Hire people who share these values
- Fire people who consistently violate them (regardless of skill)
- Reward behaviors that demonstrate values
- Make values part of performance reviews

### For Everyone:
- When in doubt, choose the path that honors these values
- If values conflict with deadlines, values win
- If values conflict with client requests, have an honest conversation
- These are non-negotiable

---

## Value Conflicts

**Sometimes values appear to conflict. Here's how we prioritize:**

### True Partnership vs. Rapid Validation
✅ Partner with clients to define what we validate  
❌ Validate in secret and surprise them

### Disciplined Engineering vs. Speed
✅ Build quality fast through good practices  
❌ Sacrifice quality for fake speed

### Quality First vs. Rapid Validation
✅ Build minimal but solid MVPs  
❌ Build perfect products nobody wants

### Radical Transparency vs. Client Comfort
✅ Be honest with kindness  
❌ Sugarcoat problems until they explode

**When in doubt, ask: "What would a true partner do?"**

---

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether something aligns with our values:
- Ask in #values channel
- Discuss in 1:1 with your lead
- Bring it up in retrospectives
- Email Kalpa directly

**We want to live these values perfectly, not just write them down.**

---

**Remember:** These values are why clients choose OneSyntax. They're why talented developers want to work here. They're non-negotiable.

**Let's build software that matters. Together.**
