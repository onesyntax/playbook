## Demotion

### When Demotion Occurs

Demotion happens when:
- Performance consistently below level expectations
- Unable to fulfill role responsibilities
- Better fit at lower level
- Organizational restructuring

**Demotion is not punishment** - it's realignment.

- Creates improvement plan
- Documents expectations

**Step 2: Improvement Period (90 days)**
- Weekly 1:1s with specific feedback
- Measurable goals and milestones
- Support and coaching provided
- Progress documented

**Step 3: Evaluation (Day 90)**
- Review against improvement plan
- Decide: continue, promote, or demote

**Step 4: Demotion Decision**
- Manager recommendation
- HR + Leadership review
- CEO approval (for senior roles)

**Step 5: Communication (if demoting)**
- Private 1:1 meeting
- Explain rationale clearly
- Document new role and compensation
- Create path forward

### Compensation Adjustments

**Immediate (Effective with demotion):**
- Salary moves to top of lower band
- Benefits remain unchanged
- PTO/vacation unchanged

**Example:**
```
Senior Developer (450,000 LKR/month) → Developer
New salary: 250,000 LKR/month (top of IC2 band)
Reduction: 200,000 LKR/month (44%)
```

**Severance Alternative:**
- If reduction > 40%, offer 3-month severance + termination
- Employee chooses: accept demotion or take severance

### Path Back to Promotion

**Returning to higher level requires:**
1. ✅ Minimum 12 months at lower level
2. ✅ "Exceeds Expectations" performance
3. ✅ Demonstrated capability at higher level
4. ✅ Standard promotion process

**No shortcuts.** Must re-earn promotion.

### Demotion vs Termination Matrix

| Situation | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Consistent underperformance | Demotion | Can succeed at lower level |
| Willful misconduct | Termination | Violation of values |
| Refuses to improve | Termination | Not coachable |
| Skills mismatch | Demotion | Better fit exists |
| Cultural misalignment | Termination | Values violation |
| Effort but struggling | Demotion | Trying but overwhelmed |
