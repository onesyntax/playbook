## Core Principle

> **"Sustainable pace means we can maintain our quality standards indefinitely without burning out our team."**

### Why This Matters

**Our mission** is true partnership through professional development. Burnout destroys:
- Code quality (tired developers cut corners)
- Partnership (exhausted teams can't communicate well)
- Professional growth (no energy left for learning)
- Trust (clients notice when teams are stretched thin)

**Quality software requires:**
- Alert, focused minds
- Time for thoughtful design
- Energy for code reviews
- Capacity to handle unexpected issues

### The OneSyntax Standard

We choose **sustainable excellence over unsustainable heroics**.

Better to:
- Deliver quality work on time through good planning
- Say no to unrealistic deadlines
- Lose a client who demands the impossible
- Build reputation for reliable, quality delivery

Than to:
- Rush work and create technical debt
- Burn out team members
- Build reputation for "fast but buggy"
- Sacrifice long-term health for short-term gains

## Standard Working Hours

### Expected Schedule

**Standard work week:** 40 hours
**Typical schedule:** Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM (flexible)
**Core hours:** 10 AM - 3 PM (be available for meetings)
**Flex time:** Morning/evening hours flexible with team coordination

### What 40 Hours Means

**Included:**
- Coding and development work

---

## Overtime Policy

### Maximum Limits

**Occasional overtime acceptable:**
- Maximum 45 hours in a week
- Maximum 2 weeks above 40 hours per month
- Must be voluntary, never required

**Never acceptable:**
- Regular 50+ hour weeks
- Working weekends routinely
- Skipping vacations
- Working while sick
- Pressure to work "just a few more hours"

### When Overtime Happens

**Legitimate reasons:**
- Production incident requiring immediate fix
- Client deadline with pre-communicated urgency
- Critical bug before major launch
- Short-term project crunch (with recovery time after)

**Not legitimate reasons:**
- Poor planning by management
- Regular project delays
- "That's just how we work"
- "Everyone else does it"
- Artificial urgency

### Overtime Approval Process

**Before working overtime:**
1. Discuss with your lead/manager
2. Understand why overtime is needed
3. Agree on specific end date
4. Document expected hours
5. Plan recovery time after

**During overtime:**
- Track actual hours worked
- Communicate if it's excessive
- Raise concerns immediately
- Don't suffer in silence

**After overtime:**
- Take recovery time (half-day off, flex schedule)
- Debrief what caused need for overtime
- Plan to prevent recurrence
- Don't let it become routine

### Compensation for Overtime

**For employees:**
- Overtime pay per employment contract
- Or time-off-in-lieu (TOIL) at 1.5x rate
- Example: 4 hours overtime = 6 hours TOIL

**For contractors:**
- Paid for actual hours worked
- Overtime rate per contract terms
- Transparent time tracking

## Crunch Time Management

### What Is Crunch Time?

**Definition:** Short period (1-3 weeks) of increased intensity before major deadline.

**Not crunch time:**
- Working 50+ hours regularly
- Constant "emergency" mode
- Normal project work
- Anything longer than 1 month

### Crunch Time Triggers

**Requires approval from Kalpa for:**
- Client-facing product launch
- Major feature release with committed date
- Production incident resolution
- Time-sensitive competitive opportunity

**Does NOT justify crunch:**
- Poor estimation
- Scope creep we didn't manage
- "We've always done it this way"
- Internal arbitrary deadlines

### Crunch Time Rules

**If we enter crunch time:**

1. **Explicit declaration**
   - Team meeting to announce crunch period
   - Clear end date (not "until it's done")
   - Explanation of why it's necessary
   - Plan for recovery after

2. **Quality standards maintained**
   - No shortcuts on DDD/Clean Architecture
   - Tests still required
   - Code reviews still happen
   - Technical debt not acceptable

3. **Hours limits**
   - Maximum 50 hours per week
   - No more than 2 weeks at this pace
   - Weekends only if voluntary + compensated

4. **Team support**
   - Daily check-ins on wellbeing
   - Option to opt-out without penalty
   - Extra coffee, snacks, whatever helps
   - Clear communication of progress

5. **Recovery period**
   - Mandatory recovery time after
   - Lighter workload following week
   - Retrospective on what caused crunch
   - Plan to prevent recurrence

### When to Say No to Crunch

**Kalpa will reject crunch time if:**
- Team already worked overtime recently
- Deadline is artificial/arbitrary
- Client relationships can handle delay
- Quality would be significantly compromised
- Team members are showing burnout signs

3. **Model behavior**
   - Don't work excessive hours yourself
   - Take your vacation days
   - Leave at reasonable times
   - Don't send late-night Slack messages
   - Show it's okay to disconnect

4. **Regular check-ins**
   - Weekly 1:1s to assess wellbeing
   - Ask about workload honestly
   - Listen for burnout signals
   - Act on concerns immediately

5. **Create psychological safety**
   - Make it safe to say "I'm overwhelmed"

**Action steps:**
1. Immediate conversation with affected person
2. Workload adjustment within 24 hours
3. Mandatory time off if needed
4. Root cause analysis
5. Plan to prevent recurrence
6. Escalate to Kalpa if pattern continues

## Code Quality Over Speed

### The Principle

> **"Fast code with bugs wastes more time than slightly slower code done right."**

### Math of Technical Debt

**Scenario:** Client wants feature in 1 week, realistic estimate is 2 weeks.

**Option 1: Rush it (1 week)**
- Cut corners on architecture
- Skip some tests
- Minimal code review
- Ships on time
- Bugs appear in production
- Client loses trust
- 2 weeks fixing bugs
- **Total time: 3 weeks + damaged reputation**

**Option 2: Do it right (2 weeks)**
- Proper architecture
- Full test coverage
- Thorough code review
- Ships 1 week "late"
- Works correctly
- Client happy
- No bug fixes needed
- **Total time: 2 weeks + maintained reputation**

### When Clients Push

**Client:** "We need this in 1 week."  
**Us:** "We can deliver quality work in 2 weeks, or rushed work in 1 week that will need fixing. Which do you prefer?"

**Most clients choose quality when framed honestly.**

### Saying No Professionally

**Templates for pushback:**

**To clients:**
> "I understand the urgency. To deliver quality work that maintains our standards, we need X weeks. If we rush it, we risk bugs that will delay your launch further. Which timeline works better for your goals?"

**To management:**
> "This timeline requires cutting quality corners. I'm not comfortable shipping substandard work with our name on it. Can we negotiate the scope or timeline?"

**To yourself:**
> "Staying late to rush this feature will result in bugs tomorrow. Better to work sustainable hours and deliver quality."

## Enforcement & Accountability

### How We Maintain Sustainable Pace

**Preventive measures:**
- Realistic sprint planning
- Buffer time in estimates
- Regular retrospectives on workload
- Velocity tracking to inform planning
- Saying no to overcommitment

**Monitoring:**
- Manager 1:1s reviewing workload
- Team retrospectives on pace
- Anonymous quarterly surveys
- Tracking overtime hours
- Code quality metrics (fatigue shows here)

**Consequences for violations:**

**If individual works excessive hours:**
- Manager conversation about why
- Mandatory time off to recover
- Workload redistribution
- If pattern continues: performance concern

**If manager pushes team too hard:**
- Team escalates to Kalpa
- Immediate intervention
- Manager coaching on boundaries
- If pattern continues: manager change

**If company culture drifts:**
- Team retrospective to address
- Leadership commitment to fix
- Policy reminders
- External audit if needed

### Team Responsibility

**Everyone has responsibility to:**
- Flag when they're overwhelmed
- Not work excessive hours silently
- Speak up in retrospectives
- Support teammates' boundaries
- Report manager pressure

**Culture we're building:**
- It's safe to say "I need help"
- It's respected to leave on time
- It's encouraged to take vacations
- It's professional to set boundaries

## Exceptions & Edge Cases

### Production Emergencies

**When production is down:**
- Work until fixed (with rotation)
- Mandatory recovery time after
- Post-mortem to prevent recurrence
- Compensate time worked

**This should be rare** (< 4 times per year)

### Pre-Launch Crunch

**Major product launches may require:**
- Extra hours in final 2 weeks
- Weekend testing/deployment
- All hands on deck

**Requirements:**
- Pre-planned recovery period
- Voluntary participation
- TOIL or overtime pay
- Quality standards maintained

### Personal Choice

**If someone wants to work extra:**
- Learning new technology
- Personal project
- Extra code review participation
- Helping teammates

**This is fine if:**
- Truly voluntary
- Not expected of others
- Doesn't set bad precedent
- Sustainable for that person

**This is not fine if:**
- Pressure from others
- Fear of being seen as lazy
- Making others look bad
- Burning them out
