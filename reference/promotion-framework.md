## Career Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Merit-Based Advancement**
- Promotions based on demonstrated capability, not politics or tenure
- Must prove you can operate at next level before promotion
- Quality of work > quantity of work > years of service

**2. Objective Criteria**
- Clear, measurable standards for each level
- Evidence-based decision making
- No subjective "feeling" promotions

**3. Transparent Process**
- Everyone knows what's required
- Regular feedback on progress
- No surprise promotions or denials

**4. Alignment with OneSyntax Mission**
- Must embody partnership and accountability
- Quality standards are non-negotiable at all levels
- Teaching and mentoring valued highly

---

### What Promotions Mean

**At OneSyntax, promotion means:**

✅ **New Responsibilities** - You can handle more complex work  
✅ **Greater Autonomy** - You can make decisions independently  
✅ **Leadership Opportunity** - You can guide and teach others  
✅ **Higher Compensation** - Reflects increased value delivery  
✅ **Professional Recognition** - Internal and external validation

**Promotions are NOT:**

❌ Automatic after X years  
❌ Political favors  
❌ Retention tools (counter-offers)  
❌ Entitlements  
❌ Based on likability

- Proactive teaching and mentoring
- Solving hard problems independently
- Client praise and repeat requests
- Improving team/company systems
- External recognition (talks, articles)

**How to Fast Track:**

2. **Seek feedback actively** (monthly, not just annual)
3. **Address gaps quickly** (don't ignore weaknesses)
4. **Build relationships** (collaboration matters)
5. **Demonstrate next level** (before promotion, not after)

---

## Special Tracks

### Specialist Track (Alternative to Staff)

**For developers who:**
- Want to go deep, not broad
- Prefer individual contribution over leadership

- Principal Specialist (equivalent to Principal)

**Criteria:**
- Deep expertise in narrow area
- Recognized expert internally and externally
- Solves hardest problems in domain
- Teaches and documents extensively

**Example Specialties:**
- Performance optimization
- Security architecture
- Data modeling
- Specific technology (GraphQL, etc.)

---

### Returning Employee Track

**If someone leaves and returns:**

**Re-entry Level:**
- Previously Junior: Return as Junior (prove again)
- Previously Mid: Return as Junior or Mid (depending on gap)
- Previously Senior: Return as Mid or Senior (case by case)

**Accelerated Promotion:**
- Can fast-track if previously proven
- Must still meet current standards

- Terminated if serious issues

**Why Strict:**
- Protects team culture
- Ensures consistent standards
- Prevents title inflation
- "Senior" means something at OneSyntax

A: Yes, but must meet all criteria including time-at-level minimums typically.

**Q: What if I'm close but not quite meeting criteria?**  
A: Apply anyway and get feedback. Committee may say "not yet but close, reapply in 3 months."

**Q: Can my manager block my application?**  
A: No. Anyone can apply. Manager gives recommendation but doesn't have veto.

### Criteria

**Q: Are criteria strict or flexible?**  
A: Criteria are strict and must be met. But evidence can vary - multiple ways to demonstrate competency.

**Q: What if I meet some but not all criteria?**  
A: You won't be promoted until you meet all required criteria. Gaps will be identified clearly.

**Q: Do I need to be perfect?**  
A: No, but you need to consistently meet standards at next level, not just occasionally.

---

### Compensation

**Q: When does new salary take effect?**  
A: Beginning of next pay period after promotion effective date.

**Q: Can I negotiate the promotion raise?**  
A: Salary is based on band placement. Limited negotiation possible if you have compelling evidence of higher value.

**Q: What if I'm already at top of my current band?**  
A: Promotion moves you to next band. You won't be capped.

---

### Denials

**Q: If denied, when can I reapply?**  
A: Typically 6-12 months, depending on gaps identified.

**Q: Will denial hurt my career?**  
A: No. Applying shows ambition. Use feedback to improve.

**Q: Can I appeal?**  
A: Yes, if you believe process was unfair or incomplete. See appeals section.

---

### Other

**Q: What if I want to change tracks (technical to leadership)?**  
A: Possible. Discuss with manager. May need to demonstrate new competencies.

**Q: What if I don't want to be promoted?**  
A: That's fine. Not everyone wants higher levels. Can stay at current level indefinitely if performing well.

**Q: What about cost of living adjustments?**  
A: Separate from promotions. Everyone gets COLA annually.
