- Q2: $2,000 (momentum building)
- Q3: $2,200 (full capability)
- Q4: $2,200 (sustained excellence)

**Team Metrics (60% of calculation):**
- Architecture test pass rate (target: 95%+)
- Code coverage percentage (target: 80%+)
- Kalpa's review time saved (target: -50%)
- Client satisfaction maintained (target: 4.5/5)

**Individual Contribution (40% of calculation):**

- Mentor/teaching contributions (counted)
- Zero major violations (bonus)

**Payout Calculation Example:**

For Q2 ($2,000 pool):

**Team Performance (60% = $1,200):**
- If team hits 80%+ of targets → Full $1,200
- If team hits 60-79% → $900
- If team hits <60% → $600

**Individual Contribution (40% = $800):**
- Top contributor: 25% = $200
- Second tier (3 people): 20% each = $160
- Third tier (4 people): 10% each = $80
- Participation (2 people): 5% each = $40

**Example Payout:**
- Team hit 85% of targets → Everyone gets base share
- Top performer: $120 (team) + $200 (individual) = $320
- Average performer: $120 (team) + $80 (individual) = $200
- New developer: $120 (team) + $40 (participation) = $160
